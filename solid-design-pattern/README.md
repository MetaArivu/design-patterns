# SOLID 

## Single Responsbility Pattern
    For this there should be never be more than one reasone to change the class. Focused on single functionality and address specific concern.

## Open Closed Principle
    It should be open for extension but close for modification.
    
## Liskov Substitution Principle
    Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

## Interface Segregation Principle
    Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use. The goal of this principle is to reduce the side effects of using larger interfaces by breaking application interfaces into smaller ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle
    The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
